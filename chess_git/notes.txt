Chess in Vanilla JS ❤

TODOS:
    - CSS chessboard ✅
    - Make pawns texture ✅
    - Set pawns on chessboard ✅

    IDEA:
        I use only WHITE PAWNS as texture,
        so I can turn them black using FILTER: INVERT(1);
        when data-pawn-color is set to black

    PROBLEM:

        ⭕ while BLACK PAWNS are dragged
        FILTER doesn't work and prawn are WHITE

        ⭕ it's possible to CHANGE PAWNS BEHAVIOR
        using browsers inspector tool and changing
        the DATA-PAWN-COLOR ATTRIBUTE,
        which is responsible for pawns 
        color and BEHAVIOR

    - Drag and drop to move ❌
        - Pawns need to have specified rules
        on how they move
        - Knight can castle only
        if he didn't move before, and
        hes not under attak (I will add attack later)

        DRAG IDEA 1 (in Sandbox mode):

            - Dragged object is changing it's top and left position absolute
            referencing the window innerWidth and innerHeight,
            Thus the pawn can move anywhere it want's, when pawn is placed
            I remove IT'S CUREENT POSITION, and i place it in square (div). ⚠      

    - Interraction between pawns ❌
        - Knight can't be captured by any pawn,
        and can't take pawn if it's protected
        - The "en passanr rule":

            If a pawn takes a double step from its starting position
            and lands directly beside an opposing pawn,
            then on the next move only the latter may take the first pawn
            as though it had only advanced a single square
